# GH2GYM and 80SGYM
Your favorite way to play vanilla GH2 or GH80S, for both PS2 and Xbox 360

# About
This mod was made as a love letter to vanilla Guitar Hero 2.

You won't find over the top gh2dx style features here, this is meant to be your favorite way to experience Vanilla Guitar Hero II or Vanilla Guitar Hero Rocks the 80s in the modern era.

GH2GYM tries to be pretty conservative in the mods that were added to the game, all in service to feel similar to things like speedrunner practice roms.

Accessibility and ways to keep it fresher, without obscuring the vision of the original game. We hope you enjoy it.

# Permadeath information
Permadeath has gone through several revisions in this mod, and I believe we have found a new balance that will be fun for both top tier players, as well as players looking to boost their skill. You can now set a percentage threshold for accuracy, for a song to count as "won" in permadeath. The range is from 80%, to 99.9%. This means you don't have to hit every single note, you just have to beat your set accuracy threshold.

There are also a customizable amount of lives, up to 10, that you can give yourself before you lose completely and have to start back from square 1.

Permadeath modes will now provide helpful information in the song list and endgame overview for easy tracking of progress. This includes, the target accuracy percentage, worst accuracy so far, total note streak if going for FC permadeath, and number of songs complete out of total.

<a id="randomizer_information"></a>
# Randomizer information
Randomizer has also been added to this mod. You can activate randomizer with, or without permadeath enabled. PS2 cannot save the randomized setlist, but on xbox 360, a non-permadeath randomizer run will save progress so you can play at your leisure.

While in Randomizer, All songs will show as "??????????", with no store descriptions, loading tips, or anything else to give you a clue on the song. You only find out when the song audio starts.

<a id="strum_limit_information"></a>
# Strum limit information
Thanks to some new advancements, the strum limit can now be toggled at will from the in-game bootup settings. When Trogdor, the impossible song to FC on NTSC, comes up, strum limit will auto be disabled in all modes, so the song can actually be completed.

<a id="force_guitar_information"></a>
# Force guitar information
Some specific setups may not be able to recognize connected devices as guitar. Previously in these cases, a seperated build was required to switch between normal device mapping, and force all is guitar. Thanks to new advancements, this is now possible from the in-game bootup menu.

<a id="audio_lag_information"></a>
# Audio lag information
You can now adjust the audio and video lag independently for the first time EVER in GH2!
You can adjust the audio and still play in time with the visuals, and vice versa. No more playing early!

Auto-Calibration works! And it works way better than it did in vanilla GH2, providing results as accurate as possible!
